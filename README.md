# ⛩️ Wish Plaque — On-Chain Shrine Wishing Wall

> *"Sharing pain halves it. Sharing joy doubles it."*
> 「痛苦分享可以减半，快乐分享就会加倍。」

A native Android app that turns the ancient Japanese shrine tradition of writing wishes on wooden plaques into a permanent, on-chain experience. Every wish is stored as a real Solana account — immutable, public, and witnessed by the world.

Built for the **Solana Mobile Hackathon** as a first-class mobile experience using the Solana Mobile Stack.

## 🔗 On-Chain Architecture

Each wish is stored as a standalone **PDA (Program Derived Address)** account on Solana:

```
WishWallState PDA  →  stores total_wishes counter
Wish PDA [1..N]    →  each wish: owner, content, nickname, created_at, status
```

**Data fetching flow (no indexer required):**
1. Fetch `WishWallState` PDA → read `total_wishes`
2. Derive all wish PDAs deterministically (`wish_id` 1 → N)
3. Batch fetch with `getMultipleAccountsInfo` (100 per batch)
4. Manual Borsh deserialization (BorshCoder is incompatible with Hermes)

**Transaction signing flow:**
- Uses `wallet.signAndSendTransactions()` + MWA `reauthorize` — delegates signing and broadcast entirely to the wallet app, solving silent failure issues in Hermes.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Android device or emulator with a Solana wallet installed (e.g. [Phantom Mobile](https://phantom.app/download))
- JDK 17+ and Android SDK (for local APK build)

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run in development

```bash
npm run android
```

### Build release APK locally

```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
# APK → android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Update `src/utils/constants.ts` to point to your deployed program:

```typescript
export const WISH_WALL_PROGRAM_ID = new PublicKey('YOUR_PROGRAM_ID');
export const CLUSTER = 'devnet'; // or 'mainnet-beta'
```

## 🧩 Key Engineering Challenges

### 1. Silent transaction failures in Hermes
The standard pattern — `signTransactions()` → manual serialization → `sendRawTransaction()` — failed silently in React Native's Hermes engine: the wallet confirmed but nothing landed on-chain.

**Fix:** delegate everything to `wallet.signAndSendTransactions()` combined with MWA's `reauthorize` flow.

### 2. Borsh deserialization without BorshCoder
Anchor's `BorshCoder` relies on browser APIs incompatible with Hermes.

**Fix:** wrote manual byte-level Borsh parsing functions (`readU32LE`, `readU64LE`, `readString`) to deserialize on-chain account data from scratch.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Wish donations — support others' wishes with SOL
- [ ] NFT plaques — mint fulfilled wishes as on-chain keepsakes
- [ ] Social layer — react to wishes, build connections
- [ ] Search & filter wishes
- [ ] Push notifications on wish fulfillment
- [ ] Mainnet deployment with reduced account size
